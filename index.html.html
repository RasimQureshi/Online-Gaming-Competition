<h3><span style="font-size:40px;"><span style=color:#0000cd;>Introduction to online gaming</span></span></h3>
<span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;><p>Online gaming is hugely popular with children and young
people. Annual research conducted by <strong>OFCOM</strong> shows
that gaming is still one of the top activities enjoyed by
5-16 year olds online, with many of them gaming via
mobile devices and going online using their games
console.</p>
<p>From sport related games to mission based games and
quests inspiring users to complete challenges,
interactive games cater for a wide range of interests,
and can enable users to link up and play together.<br>
Most games now have an online element to them;
allowing users to take part in leader boards, join group
games or chat to others. Internet connectivity in a game
adds a new opportunity for gamers as it allows players
to find and play against, or with, other players. These
may be their friends or family members or even other
users in the game from around the world (in a multiplayer game). </p></span>

<h3><span style="font-size:40px;"><span style=color:#0000cd;>How to play </span></span></h3>
<span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;><p>There are many ways for users to play games online. This
includes free games found on the internet, games on
smartphones, tablets and handheld consoles, as well as
downloadable and boxed games on PCs and consoles such
as the PlayStation, Nintendo Wii or Xbox. Here are some of the
most common devices on which online games are played </p></span>

<ul>
<li><span style=color:#0000cd;">Consoles</span>: <span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;>These games are played on home
entertainment consoles designed to work with a TV.
Consoles are capable of connecting to the internet via
a home network just like other devices. This allows users to
purchase and download games, purchase additional content
for games (eg extra levels, characters, features) as well as
playing online, although a subscription may be required to use
a particular gaming network. The main manufacturers
(Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft) include parental controls in
their consoles that are linked to age <strong>ratings</strong> systems</span></li>
<br>

<li><span style=color:#0000cd;>Mobile App Games</span>: <span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;>TMobile games can be free or
chargeable and are downloadable through app
stores like Google Play or Apple App Store. There
may be costs associated with mobile gaming as within some
games, even free ones, there are opportunities to purchase
added functionality such as in-app purchases. However,
these functions can be <strong>deactivated</strong>, either through settings on
a device or via settings on an account used to access the appstore. </span></li>
<br>

<li><span style=color:#0000cd;>Handheld Games:</span>: <span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;>Handheld games are played on
small portable consoles. As with other devices,
handheld games are also internet enabled. This
allows gamers to download games, purchase additional
content, get new features and play and chat to other gamers.</span></li>
<br>

<li><span style=color:#0000cd;>PC Games:</span>: <span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;>These games are played on a computer
the same way as other software programmes. There
are also a large number of free games available to
download and play that offer limited features with an option to
buy extra features or unlock all <strong>features</strong> via a monthly
subscription. Many PC games make use of the internet, and
many Massively <strong>Multiplayer</strong> Online (MMO) games, where
gamers interact together in virtual spaces, are PC games.</span></li></ul>

<h3><span style="font-size:40px;"><span style=color:#0000cd;>FAQ's </span></span></h3>

<span style=color:#0000cd;>.Do games have parental controls?</span><br><br><span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;>Lots of games have safety or privacy features to keep young
gamers safe which you can set based on your childâ€™s age and
maturity. These settings may limit who players can chat with or
what they can say. These features may also control the game
content they can play. Games and services will approach
privacy and safety in a variety of ways so it is worth getting to
know the features on the games your child plays. However,
these controls are not a substitute for parental involvement. You
can find out more information about how to set up the parental
controls on each device by visiting <strong>www.saferinternet.org.uk/
parent-tech</strong>. </span>
<br>
<br>

<span style=color:#0000cd;>.How can I keep my child safe whilst they chat in games? What tools are available to help? </span><br><br><span style=font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;>Many games offer users the ability to chat with other gamers
during the game. Players can communicate by typing
messages which can be seen by all players or by sending
private messages to just one player. Some games also allow
users to chat using a headset which is similar to talking on the
phone.
Parental control tools are available on PCs and consoles, and
these can limit gameplay functionality, including chat. Make
sure your children know how to protect their privacy by locking
down privacy features. These could include using a voice mask
to disguise their voice in a multiplayer game as well as how to
block and report other players and use the mute function which
can disable chat in many games.
Advise them never to give out any personal information
(including pictures of themselves) or agree to meet someone in
person when using online chats or sharing information in their
user profile. Encourage your child to use an appropriate screen
or character name (sometimes called gamertags) that follow
the rules of the game service.
In addition, many gamers chat on community forums about the
games they are playing. Gamers use these sites to exchange
information about the games as well as to provide tips and
hints to others. It is important to encourage your child to be
positive and respectful as well as manage their privacy on
these sites too and locate the means for reporting any issues
they encounter.  </span>
